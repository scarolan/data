## Project Overview

**Data** is an LLM-powered Slack chatbot with a Star Trek personality (Lt. Commander Data). It uses the Slack Bolt framework with **Ollama** (default) or **Gemini** as the chat backend, and Gemini (Nano Banana 2) for image generation.

The chat layer talks to each provider's native SDK — no OpenAI chat/completions compatibility shim. Conversation history is owned by the bot (persisted in Redis via Keyv), not by the LLM provider.

## Quick Reference

```bash
npm install      # Install dependencies
npm start        # Run the bot
npm test         # Run tests (node --test)
npm run lint     # Check code style
npm run lint:fix # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format   # Format with Prettier
```

## Architecture

- **`app.js` is a thin glue layer** (~300 lines) that wires Bolt handlers onto pure helpers in `lib/`
- **Socket Mode**: no public URL required; uses WebSocket connection
- **Persistence**: Redis-backed via Keyv for conversation context (per-user message history)
- **Node.js 22+** (CI matrices on 22, 24; production runs 22 LTS)
- ESM modules throughout

## Layout

```
app.js                     # Bolt handler wiring + start()

  chat.js                  # handleMessage — backend-agnostic, history in convoStore
  chat-backends.js         # makeOllamaChat() / makeGeminiChat() adapter factories
  image.js                 # generateImage via Gemini (client + model injected)

## Key Exports

`app.js` only boots the bot when run as the main module (`import.meta.url === \`file://${process.argv[1]}\``); importing it from tests is safe. It re-exports the unit-testable functions from `lib/`:

| Export | Source | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `handleMessage(msg, { chat, convoStore })` | `lib/chat.js` | Route Slack message through the chat adapter; returns `{ text }` |
| `clearHistory(userId, { convoStore })` | `lib/chat.js` | Delete a user's stored conversation history (backs `/forget`) |
| `generateImage(prompt, { client, model })` | `lib/image.js` | Call Gemini and return a PNG `Buffer` |
| `registerHandlers(deps)` | `app.js` | Attach all Bolt listeners to `deps.app` |
| `start(deps)` | `app.js` | Wire signals + register handlers + `app.start()` |

## Chat backends

`lib/chat-backends.js` exposes two factories that each return an object with a uniform `chat({ messages }) → { text }` method. `handleMessage` only ever calls this method — it has no idea which provider it's talking to.

| Backend | SDK | Model env | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----------|-------|
| `ollama` (default) | `ollama` npm package | `OLLAMA_MODEL` (default `gemma4:26b-a4b-it-qat`) | Talks to `OLLAMA_HOST`. Strips Llama tokenizer artifacts. Room to extend with `tools`, `format`, vision. |
| `gemini` | `@google/genai` | `GEMINI_CHAT_MODEL` (default `gemini-3-flash-latest`) | Reuses the same client as image generation. Translates roles (`assistant` → `model`) and lifts the system message into `config.systemInstruction`. |

Pick the backend with `CHAT_BACKEND=ollama|gemini`. System message is bound at adapter construction time, not passed per call.

## Message Handlers

1. **General messages** (`app.message()`) — DMs, channel messages, MPIM
2. **Direct mentions** (`app.message(directMention())`) — `@Data` mentions
3. **Slash commands**
   - `app.command('/image')` — Image generation via Gemini
   - `app.command('/forget')` — Wipe the invoking user's conversation history (calls `clearHistory`)

## Environment Variables

Loaded from `.env` via dotenv (see `.env.example`).

**Required:**
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` — Bot OAuth token (`xoxb-...`)
- `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` — App-level token for Socket Mode (`xapp-...`)
- `SLACK_BOT_USER_NAME` — Bot's display name in Slack
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — required for the `/image` slash command, and for chat when `CHAT_BACKEND=gemini`

**Optional:**
- `CHAT_BACKEND` — `ollama` (default) or `gemini`
- `OLLAMA_HOST` — Ollama endpoint (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
- `OLLAMA_MODEL` — Ollama chat model (default: `gemma4:26b-a4b-it-qat`)
- `GEMINI_CHAT_MODEL` — Gemini chat model (default: `gemini-3-flash-latest`)
- `GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL` — override the default image model (default: `gemini-3.1-flash-image`)
- `BOT_PERSONALITY` — Custom system prompt
- `REDIS_URL` — Redis connection (default: `redis://localhost:6379`)
- `MEMORY_TTL_HOURS` — Conversation memory lifetime (default: 24)

## Code Style

- ESM modules (`import`/`export`)
- Prettier: 2-space indent, 100 char width, trailing commas (ES5)
- ESLint with Prettier integration
- Async/await for all async operations

## External APIs

- **Slack** (Bolt SDK) — Messaging, file uploads, events
- **Ollama** (`ollama` npm package) — Native chat API, default backend
- **Google Gemini** (`@google/genai`) — Image generation (`gemini-3.1-flash-image`, "Nano Banana 2") and optional chat backend (`gemini-3-flash-latest`)
- **icanhazdadjoke.com** — Dad jokes endpoint
- **Redis** — Conversation history persistence

## Vision

When an incoming message has image attachments, `app.js::extractMessageImages` fetches each via the Slack file URL with the bot token, base64-encodes them, and attaches as `images: [{ mimeType, data }]` on the canonical user turn. Adapters translate to Ollama's `message.images` (base64 strings) or Gemini's `inlineData` parts. Image bytes are not persisted to history.

## Reactions UX

While Data is thinking, the bot adds a `:brain:` reaction to the user's message (via `reactions.add`) and removes it before posting the reply. Requires `reactions:read` and `reactions:write` scopes — see `manifest.yaml`.

## Thread-aware replies

Channel @-mentions reply in-thread: if the mention is inside an existing thread, the reply continues that thread; otherwise a new thread is started rooted at the mention. Tool side effects (image uploads, joke posts) also land in-thread. DMs reply flat as before.

## Canned Responses

Pattern matchers live in `lib/responses.js` as pure functions; the Bolt handlers in `app.js` are thin shims that call `say()` with the result:

- `"i love you"` → `"I know."`
- `"open the pod bay door"` → HAL 9000 reference
- `"danceparty"` → Emoji celebration
- `"rickroll"` / `"tiktok"` → button to external page
- `"help"` (when @-mentioned) → command list
- `"the rules"` (when @-mentioned) → Asimov's laws
- `"dad joke"` (when @-mentioned) → fetched from icanhazdadjoke.com

## Testing

- Uses Node.js built-in test runner (`node --test`)
- Tests live under `test/` — one `*.test.js` per source module
- **Tests must not require any env vars or external services.** Mock the external clients (Slack/Bolt, Ollama, Gemini, fetch) at the boundary; test real internal logic directly. See `test/chat.test.js` for the convoStore + adapter mock pattern.
- CI: lint → tests → syntax-check `app.js` and every `lib/*.js` → `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` (non-blocking)

## Common Tasks

**Adding a new canned response:** Add a matcher + helper to `lib/responses.js`, write a unit test for it in `test/responses.test.js`, then add a thin call site inside `registerHandlers()` in `app.js`.

**Modifying bot personality:** Set `BOT_PERSONALITY` env var, or edit the default in `buildDeps()` in `lib/deps.js`. Personality is bound at adapter construction; restart to pick up changes.

**Adding a new chat backend:** Add a `make<Backend>Chat(...)` factory in `lib/chat-backends.js` that returns `{ async chat({ messages }) → { text } }`. Wire backend selection in `buildDeps()`. Add tests in `test/chat-backends.test.js` that assert the wire-format translation.

**Note: tool calling is intentionally not part of the architecture.** It was experimented with (see git history around PR #30 and the revert that followed) and removed: the gemma family — Data's preferred backend for its strong vision — emits tool calls as inline text rather than Ollama's structured `tool_calls` field, and most of the original tool registry just duplicated regex matchers that already worked. Image generation is the `/image` slash command (Data also nudges users toward it when they ask for an image in chat via `isImageRequest` + `IMAGE_REQUEST_GUIDANCE`).

## Model selection notes (lessons from PR #30)

These are practical, hard-earned notes about which Ollama models do what well, and what's worth knowing when picking `OLLAMA_MODEL`. Save your future self a debugging session.

### gemma4:26b-a4b-it-qat (current default)
- Same gemma4 family as `gemma4:31b` below, in an MoE shape: ~26B total params, ~4B active per token (`a4b`), instruction-tuned (`it`), quantization-aware-trained (`qat`). The draw is much lower active-param cost — faster responses and a smaller memory footprint than the 31B dense default — while staying in the family Data relies on for vision.
- **Vision / tool calling: expected to match the family** (strong vision, broken structured tool calls) since it shares the gemma4 lineage, but this has NOT been verified live yet. Confirm vision quality in Slack before fully trusting it, and assume tools are still text-emitted (we don't use tools anyway — see "Why tool calling was removed").
- If it underperforms the 31B on vision in practice, fall back by setting `OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma4:31b`.

### gemma4:31b (previous default)
- **Vision: excellent.** Identified a "communist cat meme" correctly including the hammer-and-sickle symbolism and explained the joke premise unprompted. Strong recognition + sophisticated comprehension.
- **Tool calling: broken.** Knows what tools are, knows their schemas, but emits calls as plain text — e.g. `<call:generate_image{prompt:"..."}><tool_call|>` — instead of populating Ollama's structured `message.tool_calls` field. Wire-format / template issue, not a prompting issue. Same behavior on `gemma4-openhands:latest` (the agent fine-tune of the same family), so it's a family-wide limitation, not a base-model thing.
- **Thinking: emits `message.thinking` even when `think:` param is NOT sent.** Found this the hard way when an inline thinking block appeared in Slack with no thinking knob enabled. (The thinking plumbing has since been removed entirely — see "Why thinking-trace rendering was removed" below.)
- Verdict: use for chat + vision. Don't try to use it for tools.

### qwen3.6:27b
- **Tool calling: reliable.** Tested against `generate_image` and a 7-tool registry; structured `tool_calls` came back cleanly with rich, well-formed args.
- **Vision: not confirmed.** Likely no (Qwen vision is a separate `qwen2.5-vl` family). Didn't test live.
- Verdict: pick this when tools matter and vision doesn't.

### What's pulled on `kepler.local`
As of this writing: `gemma4:latest`, `gemma4:31b`, `gemma4-openhands:latest`, `llama3.3:70b-instruct-q8_0` (75GB, slow), `qwen3.6:27b`, `qwen3.6-openhands:latest`, `qwen3.6:35b-a3b`, `qwen3-coder-next:latest`, `qwen3-coder-openhands:latest`, `devstral-small-2:latest`, `nomic-embed-text:latest`. None of these are vision+tools-in-one. If you ever want both natively, pull something like `qwen2.5-vl:32b` or `mistral-small3.1` and try.

### Why tool calling was removed
1. **6 of 7 tools duplicated regex matchers** (`tell_dad_joke`, `state_asimovs_laws`, `show_help`, `start_dance_party`, `play_rickroll`, `play_tiktok`) — slower and less reliable than the existing exact-phrase triggers.
2. The one tool that did benefit from LLM intent extraction (`generate_image`) was unreliable on gemma — and gemma is the right model for everything else.
3. `/image` slash command already covers image generation reliably with no LLM round-trip.
4. The tool registry + dispatch loop was ~800 lines of code for net-negative reliability.

If you ever bring tools back: make sure the model in production actually emits structured `tool_calls` before you wire it up. Test live against a 2-tool registry first.

### Lessons from shipping vision (#26)
- Slack tags file uploads with `subtype: 'file_share'`. The pre-#26 handler had `if (message.subtype) return;` which silently dropped every upload. Fix: allow `file_share` through, skip only the genuinely-noise subtypes.
- Image fetch needs the bot token as a bearer header against `file.url_private` — these aren't anonymous URLs.
- Don't persist image bytes to convoStore. The Slack URLs expire and the bytes are big. Persist only the text portion of the user turn.
- Add explicit log lines around vision (`Vision: extracted ...`, `Ollama chat -> model with N image(s)`). When the pipeline silently dropped uploads pre-fix, we had NO observability — the bot just looked broken.

### Lessons from shipping reactions UX (#28)
- Requires `reactions:read` and `reactions:write` scopes in `manifest.yaml`.
- After adding scopes, you MUST re-sync the manifest in api.slack.com AND reinstall the app to the workspace. Failure mode: `missing_scope` errors on every `reactions.add` call, no reaction ever appears, bot looks unresponsive while it's actually working fine.

### Why thinking-trace rendering was removed (#27)
- gemma4 emits `message.thinking` even without `think:` set, and the traces are *long* (full chain-of-thought paragraphs).
- The inline Block Kit rendering — italicized "Thinking: …" context block above the reply — made every message a wall of text, and Slack gives no easy way to collapse/hide it.
- The `:brain:` reaction is enough of an "I'm working on this" UI. The rendering was suppressed first (#27), then the whole plumbing was ripped out: the adapters no longer capture `message.thinking`, `handleMessage` returns `{ text }` only, and the `OLLAMA_THINK` / `think` knob is gone. If you ever want it back, re-add the `think` param in `makeOllamaChat` and surface `result.thinking` from `handleMessage`.

**Adding a new slash command:** Register with `app.command('/commandname')` inside `registerHandlers()` in `app.js`, and add the entry to `manifest.yaml`. Remember to re-sync the manifest to the Slack app and reinstall before Slack will route the new command.

**Adding a function that calls an external API:** Don't instantiate the client at module scope. Add it to `buildDeps()` in `lib/deps.js`, pass it through `deps`, and accept the client as a parameter on the function so tests can inject a fake (see `generateImage` for the pattern).
